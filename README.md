# AguaClara Water Filtration Data App

Welcome to the repository of the AguaClara Water Filtration Data App, a solution aims to streamline the way water operators in Honduras monitor and analyze water filtration data. Developed with React Native using Expo, this application serves as a tool in the hands of water plant operators, enabling them to submit various metrics through a flexible, user-friendly, and offline-capable survey form, directly from their Android devices.

## Features

1. **Flexible Form Submission**: Allows operators to input data at different time intervals and review their submission history.
2. **Offline Data Input and Sync**: The ability to store data inputs locally on the device without WiFi and synchronize once the connection is restored, ensuring zero data loss and uninterrupted data logging.
3. **Data Visualization and Analysis**: Leveraging the power of Tableau, the app provides a data visualization section where operators can interact with dynamic charts and graphs generated from the collected data, offering insights into plant performance and other key metrics.
4. **Cloud Database Integration**: A seamless data pipeline that facilitates the daily update of the cloud database with the most recent collected information, guaranteeing data accuracy and consistency.
