# AguaClara Plant Operation Survey Tracking (POST) App

Welcome to the repository of the AguaClara POST App, a solution that aims to streamline how water operators in Honduras monitor and analyze water filtration data. Developed with Flutter, this application serves as a tool for water plant operators, enabling them to submit various metrics through a flexible, user-friendly, and offline-capable survey form directly from their Android devices.

## Main Features
1. **Flexible Form Submission**: Operators can input data at different intervals and review their submission history.
2. **Offline Data Input and Sync**: Storage of entries locally on the device without WiFi and synchronizes once the connection is restored.
3. **Data Visualization and Analysis**: Data visualization section where operators can interact with dynamic charts and graphs generated from the collected data.
4. **Cloud Database Integration**: Data pipeline to facilitate the daily update to the cloud database with the most recently collected information.
